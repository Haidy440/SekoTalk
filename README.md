We are excited to introduce **SekoTalk**, an audio-driven digital human generation model.

Partnering deeply with
<a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/LightX2V" target="_blank">⚡️LightX2V</a>,
SekoTalk requires only 4 NFEs for generation, leveraging the proven method behind
<a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/Qwen-Image-Lightning" target="_blank">Qwen-Image-Lightning</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/ModelTC/Wan2.2-Lightning" target="_blank">Wan2.2-Lightning</a>.

A 🆓 <a href="https://sekotalk.com" target="_blank">free online generation trial</a> 
is available, supporting audio clips up to 1 minutes ⏱️.
**Enjoy making your character talk!** 🤗
(Note: a queue is possible due to limited computing resources)
